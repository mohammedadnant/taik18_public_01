Automation ready â€“ ideal for GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or any Bash/PowerShell/Python workflow
Crossâ€‘platform â€“ Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal, Linux shells

ðŸš€ Install
Prerequisite: Make sure Python version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 is installed on your machine and that python is accessible from your terminal (PATH environment variable).

The command installs the latest version of fab on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If youâ€™re upgrading from an earlier version, simply run the same command with â€‘â€‘upgrade.
