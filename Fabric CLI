The Fabric CLI (fab) is a fast, fileâ€‘systemâ€‘inspired commandâ€‘line interface for Microsoft Fabric.
Explore, automate, and script your Fabric environmentâ€”right from your terminal.

Key features
Fileâ€‘system navigation â€“ ls, cd, mkdir, cp, rm, run
Interactive & scripting modes â€“ switch fluidly between live shell and oneâ€‘off commands
Automation ready â€“ ideal for GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or any Bash/PowerShell/Python workflow
Crossâ€‘platform â€“ Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal, Linux shells
Built on public APIs â€“ Fabric REST, OneLake, and Microsoft.Fabric ARM endpoints

ðŸš€ Install
Prerequisite: Make sure Python version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 is installed on your machine and that python is accessible from your terminal (PATH environment variable).

pip install ms-fabric-cli

The command installs the latest version of fab on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If youâ€™re upgrading from an earlier version, simply run the same command with â€‘â€‘upgrade.
